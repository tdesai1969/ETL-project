## Created filtered dataframe from specific columns
## Rename the column headers
## Transformed datetime into date
## parse the year from date column
## We selected year 2015 data to go with our crime data.
## we wrote and used the function in order to convert temperature data from Kelvin to Fahrenheit.
## Found the avg. temperature by doing groupby 

## postgres
## Create database connection using postgres sql 
## Created database called chicago.db along with tables
## Loaded DataFrames into database
## Joined two tables in postgres,run the queries in postgres

## By doing above steps we were succesfully able to connect crime and temperature data, for each day of year 2015.
